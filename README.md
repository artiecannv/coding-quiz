# Coding Quiz

## Description

I wanted to create a quiz that other web develppment students would be able to use and add on to to practice HTML, CSS, and JvaScript elements. I want high scores to be saved to the local storage, and for others to be able to pull them up as well.

## Installation

No need to install anything for this application

## Usage

When initally loading the page, the user is presented with two options: 'Play', and 'High Scores'. Click the 'Play' button to start the quiz, which has a timer and keeps track of the score of the users game. Click the "High Score' button to see the scores that are saved to the local storage.
